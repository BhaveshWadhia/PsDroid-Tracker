                android:text="Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.[1] On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest level of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere,[2][3] just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[4] When used without qualification, weather is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth
Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another.
These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude.
The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric
circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream. Weather systems in the middle latitudes,
such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow. Because Earth's axis is tilted
relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year.
On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit
can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric
heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant. Weather forecasting is the
application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Earth's weather
system is a chaotic system; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.
 Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns
Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an Anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind."
